Programming Lingo

- First class functions: Everthing you can do with other types
  you can do with functions. You can use functions like strings,
  numbers, etc.

- Expression: A block of code that results in a value.

- Invoke/Call: Run the function.

- Protocol Buffers: Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient,
  automated mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML,
  but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your
  data to be structured once, then you can use special generated
  source code to easily write and read your structured data to
  and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of
  languages. You can even update your data structure without
  breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the "old"
  format.

- Application Program Interface (API): A set of routines, protocols,
  and tools for building software applications. An API specifies
  how software components should interact. Additionaly, APIs are used
  when programming GUI components. A good API makes it easier to
  develop a program by providing the building blocks. A programmer
  then puts the blocks together.
