- V8 JavaScript Engine
V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine
V8 is written in C++ and is used in Gogole Chrome
V8 implements ECMAScript
V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application
You can write things in C++ and make it avaialable to JavaScript,
  enabling features that arent normally possible within JavaScript.

- JavaScript uses embedding (read: node.js, among other things)
  to provide the language services that are not standardized,
  such as:
  1. Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces
  2. Ways to deal with files
  3. Ways to deal with databases
  4. The ability to communicate over the internet
  5. The abilitiy to accept requests and send responses (in the
     standard format)
  6. A way to deal with work that takes a long time

- Node is a framework and a library of code

- Modules, Commonjs modules, Exports, and Require
    1. Modules: A reusable block of code whose existence does not impact
       other code.
    2. Commonjs Modules: An agreed upon standard for how code modules
       should be structured.
