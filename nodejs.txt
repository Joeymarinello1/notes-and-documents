- JavaScript Engine
A program that converts JavaScript code into something
the processor can understand

- V8 JavaScript Engine
V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine
V8 is written in C++ and is used in Gogole Chrome
V8 implements ECMAScript
V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application
You can write things in C++ and make it avaialable to JavaScript,
  enabling features that arent normally possible within JavaScript.

- JavaScript uses embedding (read: node.js, among other things)
  to provide the language services that are not standardized,
  such as:
  1. Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces
  2. Ways to deal with files
  3. Ways to deal with databases
  4. The ability to communicate over the internet
  5. The abilitiy to accept requests and send responses (in the
     standard format)
  6. A way to deal with work that takes a long time

- Node is a framework and a library of code

- Modules, Commonjs modules, Exports, and Require
    1. Modules: A reusable block of code whose existence does not impact
       other code.
    2. Commonjs Modules: An agreed upon standard for how code modules
       should be structured.
    3. Exports: A way to make something in a javascript file
       available to a different file. Because modules are self contained,
       you need to export an object to make it usable in another js file.
    4. Require: A way to access a module from a separate file.

- Object Literal: In JavaScript, an object literal is a comma-
  separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.
  Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package.
  This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems
  when combining code.
